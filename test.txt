[0:26:18] As days go by, so do his feelings
[0:29:48] Why can't it stay just like before
[0:32:90] I'm just a friend, but I feel jealous
[0:36:11] It seems he cares about you more
[0:39:66] How can I say, "I'm happy for you"
[0:42:93] If you took him away from me
[0:46:36] Doesn't he know, I'm more important
[0:49:42] My name and fame is all he needs
[0:53:95] Without a clear confession
[0:55:75] Nor an obsession
[0:57:88] You took his heart
[1:1:67] You have his full attention
[1:3:46] You're an exception
[1:5:48] Aren't you the luckiest of all?
[1:8:96] So, one, two, three
[1:9:82] Would you agree that you're the only enemy?
[1:12:71] And you're the only reason why he's not with me
[1:16:35] If I told one, someone, everyone a rumor just for fun
[1:20:24] Then wait a week, and I'm sure you'll be gone
[1:23:98] Just wait a week, and I'm sure you'll be gone
[1:27:17] ♪
[1:39:15] How will they know about what happened
[1:42:49] If you can't speak a word at all
[1:45:72] Now that I've lied a little louder
[1:48:88] Oh, I can't wait to see you fall
[1:53:43] Without a clear confession
[1:55:38] Nor an obsession
[1:57:35] You took his heart
[2:1:3] You have his full attention
[2:3:7] You're an exception

[2:10:16] So, one, two, three
[2:11:46] Would you agree that you're the only enemy?
[2:14:16] And you're the only reason why he's not with me
[2:17:95] If I told one, someone, everyone a rumor just for fun
[2:21:56] Then wait a week, and I'm sure you'll be gone
[2:24:63] Is he really worth all the things I do to you?
[2:28:0] Or am I just obsessive over you?
[2:31:33] Look at the scum without a charm
[2:33:35] Look at the tears of who I've harmed
[2:35:14] So, this is what I want
[2:38:88] Woah, yeah
